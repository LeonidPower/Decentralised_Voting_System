For local testing:
(You must have at least 3 bootstraps in order of the network to work)
(There is a file named 'inputs.txt', in which I have provided the inputs for the bootstraps if you want to enter them manually, of course you can change
the port numbers)
('syncronizer.py'is used to launch the boostraps all at once. If you decide to run the 'syncronizer.py', you must open it first and change the 4 directories)

1. Open 'Local' file

2. You can either run the 'syncronizer.py' and it will automatically set the inputs for each bootstrap node (*Small catch, when you run the synchronizer it 
will open the 3 bootstraps in the same folder as the synchronizer so the files will not be "distributed", so we recommend you make 3 seperate folders, 
and paste the project in each one, and then run the 'boot_strap.py' from each one and you should have a working network)

3. For testing the client you must also create a new folder and paste the project inside, run the 'client.py' while the other 3 bootstraps are running and 
start inserting commands.



For Online testing: 

(Slower than the local one, becase of synchronization issues and a lot of time.sleep())
(You can run the 3 bootstraps on 3 computers, or you can run them on 1 computer, as long as there are 3 bootstraps running there will be no problem)

1. I have provided a 'inputs.txt' in which there are the inputs for both online and local.
   If you decide to run the code on 3 different pc's then instead of the IP's that are set to: 127.0.0.1, you must change them to the public IP adresses of 
the computers (except the first line which is 0.0.0.0, this remains unchanged)

2. Run the 'client.py' and enjoy!
